# Exercise 3 - Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year.

year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))

leap = 'Leap year.'
not_leap = 'Not leap year.'

if year % 4 == 0:
    if year % 100 == 0:
        if year % 400 == 0:
            print(leap)
        else:
            print(not_leap)
    else:
        print(leap)
else:
    print(not_leap)
