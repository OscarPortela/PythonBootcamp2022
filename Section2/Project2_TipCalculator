#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 

#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

print('Welcome to the tip calculator!')
total = float(input('What was the total bill? $'))
percentage = int(input('What percentage tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? '))
n_people = int(input('How many people to split the bill? '))

result = (total/n_people) * (1+(percentage/100))
# result_rounded = round(result, 2)
result_rounded = "{:.2f}".format(result)
